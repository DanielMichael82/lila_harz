                        fed up with the Covid-19 pandemic.
                        A new hobby was needed after many failed attempts at finding a muse, including guitar (my poor
                        neighbours).
                        She first stumbled across resin on Instagram and began to research a list of products that were
                        needed.
                        When payday came around, Remi purchased the basics and the first cake stand was created!
                        The reaction on her social media was really positive, therefore, she decided to really give
                        resin a go!
                        8 months later and here we are. Lila Harz now has many products from coasters to tables.</p>
