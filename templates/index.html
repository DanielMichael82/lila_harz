                <p class="lead mb-5">Remi began making resin products having been sat feeling unproductive and
                    fed up with the Covid-19 pandemic.<br>
                    A new hobby was needed after many failed attempts at finding a muse, including guitar (my poor
                    neighbours).<br>
                    She first stumbled across resin on Instagram and began to research a list of products that were
                    needed.<br>
                    When payday came around, Remi purchased the basics and the first cake stand was created!<br>
                    The reaction on her social media was really positive, therefore, she decided to really give resin a
                    go!<br>
                    8 months later and here we are. Lila Harz now has many products from coasters to tables.</p>
